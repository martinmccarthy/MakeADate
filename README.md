# Make-A-Date

Originally made to find creative date ideas with my girlfriend, Make-A-Date is an app made with React.js, Node.js and Express to communicate with the Yelp API.
Using location services, Make-A-Date finds top rated locations in your area and randomly provides you with a fun day out, from food to activities, Make-A-Date gives you plenty of options.

To install and run Make-A-Date yourself:
- Download the repository
- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```cd frontend npm start```
- Run the backend using ```cd backend nodemon start```
- View the application on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

Current works in progress:
- Building a lock system to lock in one of the selections
- Upgrading the movie selection system
